# BUILDERS_Journal

This folder is a living record of the people, prompts, and processes that built **Sovereign File Tracker (SFT)**.  
It is not a changelog. It is not commit history. It is **the story of how this app was built — in human words, AI words, and raw notes from the trenches.**

## Philosophy

We believe that software should have a **voice**, and that builders (human or AI) should leave a record of their reasoning.

> Think of it as a time capsule for your build.
